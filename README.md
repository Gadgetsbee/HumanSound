HUMAN SOUND BASED DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM

The primary goal of this project is to analyse and predict the various 
respiratory diseases accurately from the sound of coughing using deep learning 
techniques.

There are so many developed methods in artificial intelligence to 
examine this sector. In this project, we performed various analyses by applying 
five-layered neural networks, of which three are hidden. The CNN model is trained in such a way that it can classify the classes more accurately. 

The proposed system of human sound-based disease classification involves using a machine learning architecture to classify diseases based on human sounds. 

The system uses voice analytics to analyse and record audio signals, extracting 
various features and parameters to identify patterns and classify different 
pathological coughs. The system utilises deep learning techniques such as 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and mel-spectrograms to effectively 
recognise and classify coughing in complex scenes. 

Experimental results have shown that this method can achieve good results in identifying and detecting 
coughing, making it a promising tool for disease classification based on human 
sound analysis.
